# Hi Everyone! 

My name is Nyan. (Nian) I was born and raised in Myanmar, moved to United States when I was 11. 

I started my career in tech as a hobby when I found a way to automate a labeling process that helped the operation increase efficiency and reduce discrepancies. That sparked my interest in IT and programming.

Since then I've taught myself how to code using free resources online (Udemy, FCC, Code Academy etc.) Last year I enrolled in Springboard's Software Engineering Track so I can learn in a better structured curriculum.  

I currently work at Salesforce as an IT Analyst. Iâ€™ve developed tools that help increase productivity for our global IT team (Techforce Innovation Program)

I'm looking to transition into a full development role to gain further experience.
